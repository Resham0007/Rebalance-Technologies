# Pong Code

I learnt how to create the Atari arcade classic game, Pong. Throughout this tutorial, I learnt how to create the game loop, draw the paddles on the canvas, add click handlers to make the paddles move, detect collisions between the ball and make it bounce off the walls and paddles, and add a running score.
